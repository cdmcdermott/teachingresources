The typical day of an Instrumentation Engineer goes like this:  

- They have to check the emails and conduct meetings with management and the clients at the start of the day.
- They work with the procurement team to purchase the new instruments and get the approvals for that.
- They participate in the process development and therefore design the process flow diagrams.
- They have to work closely with the clients and assist them in the instrumentation segment, keeping a check on the quality of the instruments.
- They make sure parts are installed correctly and perform test runs before actual operations can begin.
- They provide training to the interns and help them learning the processes.
- They also work on programming to implement the design and provide the solution.
- The testing part also comes in to the picture once the development phase is over.
- They do the physical tests of the instruments to ensure their functionality.
- They provide the updates and reports regularly to the clients.
